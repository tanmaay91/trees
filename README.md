# trees

trees.h - interface - makes the user aware of all the functions available and the argument pattern of each.
trees.c - implementation - implements all the functions mentioned in the interface. The implementation has been written separately because           the user is interested in the outcome, not the process.
main.c - a sample usage of all the functions.
